# Project Instruction
For this project, you will pick a dataset. There are a few public datasets from AirBnB, but you may also choose a dataset similar to what was used in the lessons, or an entirely different dataset. Using your dataset, you will choose 3 questions you aspire to answer from the data. 

# Project Overview
[Boston Airbnb](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston) is picked.

3 questions I want to answer from the data:
- What are the top 10 popular amenities offered?
- What is the most expensive zipcode in Boston?
- Could you predict the rental using the provided data? If you can, what is the top feature related to it by modeling?

Question Answers:
- The top 10 popular amenities offered are wireless Internet, Heating, Kitchen, Essentials, Air Conditioning, Smoke Detector, TV, Internet, Shampoo, Carbon Monoxide Detector.
- 02215 is the most expensive zipcode in Boston?
- Room type is the top feature related to price by modeling.

## Project Packages

- math, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, feature_engine
