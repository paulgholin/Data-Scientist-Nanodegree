# Project Overview
Predicting churn rates is a challenging and common problem that data scientists and analysts regularly encounter in any customer-facing business. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model to predict it and then we might try to prevent users from churning by investigating the important features from our model to improve our business.

# Project Instructions
The full dataset is 12GB, of which you can analyze a mini subset in the Udacity workspace. (Note that the mini subset is not included in my Github due to storage limitation.) Optionally, you can choose to follow the instructions in the [Udacity Spark course](https://www.udacity.com/course/learn-spark-at-udacity--ud2002) to deploy a Spark cluster on the cloud using AWS or IBM Cloud to analyze a larger amount of data.

## Project Packages:

- PySpark, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
 
## Project Processes

- Loading and Cleaning the data.

- Exploring the data and Feature Engeneering.

- Model Fitting.

- Best Model Tuning

- Feature Importance.
